<h1>ManOfTech</h1>
<p><strong>Technology Explained Simply.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>ManOfTech</strong> is an educational technology project built to simplify
complex concepts like Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Safety, and the Internet
for non-technical users.
</p>

<p>
While modern technology is advancing rapidly, many people struggle to
understand how it actually works. This project was created to bridge that gap
using clear language, real-life examples, and a clean user-focused design.
</p>

<h3>Why This Project Exists</h3>

<p>
As a student of computer applications, I noticed that technology education
often focuses on theory while ignoring clarity and accessibility.
ManOfTech focuses on <strong>understanding first</strong>, not memorization.
